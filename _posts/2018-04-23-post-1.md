<!-- Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

**spewil**: read [that bangladesh piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/opinion/sunday/the-real-cost-of-cheap-shirts.html)   
**spewil**: moved me   
**spewil**: why canâ€™t we write a grant and help people with action   
**spewil**: people have money  
**spewil**: we know how to use it   
**spewil**: letâ€™s go to bangladesh   
**spewil**: letâ€™s help these people unionize themselves 

**lqb2**: no. they can unionize themselves. they already are. what we need to do is be good allies. we are American. what we can do is shift the need for cheap t-shirts.  

**spewil**: sigh   
**spewil**: yep  
**spewil**: i hope iâ€™m doing the right thing  
**spewil**: i get so low   

**lqb2**: what matters is that you want to do the right thing and are committed to asking yourself if you are doing the right thing thru an going process or praxis.  
**lqb2**: remember, you already have thoughts about making clothes that don't require slave labor. let that work be informed by your feelings.

**spewil**: [reflection and action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed) 

**lqb2**: and also, let's throw together a page about our exploration of what to means to not buy cheap tshirts.  it can be arty. 

**spewil**: okay! letâ€™s do that 

**lqb2**: I'm thinking it's a micro blog with brief solo thoughts, research, and maybe some back and forth between us. 

**spewil**: yeah love that  
**spewil**: iâ€™m really into the idea of what techno-scientific invention-discovery can mean for overthrowing oppression when is TSID an action of creation, of love  

**lqb2**: wtf is tsid  
**lqb2**: teach me. on our burgeoning microblog.     


**spewil**: itâ€™s collapsing subject object   
**spewil**: t-shirts are objects   
**spewil**: but objects contain labor   
**spewil**: techno-scientific invention-discovery   
**spewil**: ðŸ¤“  
**spewil**: objects are little labor bubbles   
**spewil**: and labor is the product of subjects   

**lqb2**: ohhhhhhh v interesting  
**lqb2**: I'm gonna put up a jekyll site today. let's consider it a temp. over time we can explore how to redo it, make it public or private, etc.

**spewil**: great. good experiment to work on a blog via git together 

**lqb2** : I thought so. I've never actually worked with anyone on a git project 

**spewil**: keep me posted, lmk how to help   
**spewil**: should be straightforward  
**spewil**: you make it, add me as contributor  
**spewil**: ill pull it  
**spewil**: add/merge/push  
**spewil**: weâ€™ll communicate  
**spewil**: should be great  

**lqb2**: haha great isn't my goal, fwiw. my goal is learning. sometimes learning is uncomfy. ðŸ™ƒ

**spewil**: thatâ€™s great too  
**spewil**: ðŸ˜Œ

**lqb2**: ðŸ˜Š
